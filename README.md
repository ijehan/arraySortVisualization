# arraySortVisualization


This project is the creation of an array sorter; one that sorts the array visually, using different sorting methods, such as bubble sort, quick sort, etc..

The point of this site is to show people how these different algorithms sort arrays, and they can see which ones are faster, more efficient, etc. just by watching the animation played.

User Features
The user can choose which algorithm is used to sort the array.
The user can change how large or small to make the array.
